TODO:
===============================================================================
Add video tutorial(s).

LONG TERM:
===============================================================================
Move everything to Qt

If the spreadsheet is opened, allow the user to close it and then
export data, rather than having to rerun

Sign Windows installer

Allow the user to save the spreadsheet wherever he/she wants.

Consider changing errorCheck to a class so we can use individual parts when
needed instead of having to run the whole thing every time

Use a dedicated Qt window for the videos so we can look at cross-platform

DONE:
===============================================================================

DONE: Create output folder in user's home directory for output1.xls

DONE: notify if the measurement terminates before the set measurement interval,
for example if the trackers are lost after a few seconds of run time.

DONE: handle window crashes:
 - occurred from ZeroDivisionError around line 107 if the user pressed 'Cancel'
 when opening a video, or did not open a video file.
 - occurred from ZeroDivisionError on line 400 if all tracker points on a mouse
 are lost.
 - occurred from OpenCVError around line 139 when self.currentFrame is defined
 if self.filename is not actually a video.
