Add video tutorial(s).

LONG TERM:
===============================================================================
If the spreadsheet is opened, allow the user to close it and then
export data, rather than having to rerun

Sign Windows installer

Allow the user to save the spreadsheet wherever he/she wants.

Use a dedicated Qt window for the videos so we can look at cross-platform

DONE:
===============================================================================
DONE: Remove unused checkBox

DONE: Assign descriptive names in the Qt UI code

DONE: Generate output.xls if one does not already exist

DONE: Fix `Quit` option where only the main window closes

DONE: Move to Qt 5

DONE: Move to Python 3

DONE: get opencv dll for Windows 32-bit

DONE: Only one graph per mouse

DONE: handle multiple data graphs in a single plot.

DONE: handle multiple plots for the same mouse.

DONE: sucessful builds for python 3.6 with PyInstaller dev

DONE: Create output folder in user's home directory for output1.xls

DONE: notify if the measurement terminates before the set measurement interval,
for example if the trackers are lost after a few seconds of run time.

DONE: handle window crashes:
 - occurred from ZeroDivisionError around line 107 if the user pressed 'Cancel'
 when opening a video, or did not open a video file.
 - occurred from ZeroDivisionError on line 400 if all tracker points on a mouse
 are lost.
 - occurred from OpenCVError around line 139 when self.currentFrame is defined
 if self.filename is not actually a video.

DONE: only use os.path.join for file paths

DONE: handle graphs cutting off part of title and x-label

DONE: combine tick() with moveSlide()

DONE: non-strict video names

DONE: allow user to check for a new release

DONE: Add sample video to GitHub repo

DONE: Detect if an existing graph for the same mouse exists from a previous run,
and overwrite as needed.

DONE: Move everything to Qt

DONE: The error check function is now a class so we can use only certain tests
as necessary

DONE: Don't enable 'Select start time' button until video is loaded (prevents
exit with errors).
