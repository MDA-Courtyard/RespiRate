    Converted from/based on a MATLAB script at:

    function for detecting local maximas and minmias in a signal.
    Discovers peaks by searching for values which are surrounded by lower
    or larger values for maximas and minimas respectively

    keyword arguments:
    y_axis -- A list containg the signal over which to find peaks
    x_axis -- (optional) A x-axis whose values correspond to the y_axis list
        and is used in the return to specify the postion of the peaks. If
        omitted an index of the y_axis is used. (default: None)
    lookahead -- (optional) distance to look ahead from a peak candidate to
        determine if it is the actual peak (default: 200)
        '(sample / period) / f' where '4 >= f >= 1.25' might be a good value
    delta -- (optional) this specifies a minimum difference between a peak and
        the following points, before a peak may be considered a peak. Useful
        to hinder the function from picking up false peaks towards to end of
        the signal. To work well delta should be set to delta >= RMSnoise * 5.
        (default: 0)
            delta function causes a 20% decrease in speed, when omitted
            Correctly used it can double the speed of the function

    return -- two lists [max_peaks, min_peaks] containing the positive and
        negative peaks respectively. Each cell of the lists contains a tupple
        of: (position, peak_value)
        to get the average peak value do: np.mean(max_peaks, 0)[1] on the
        results to unpack one of the lists into x, y coordinates do:
        x, y = zip(*tab)
